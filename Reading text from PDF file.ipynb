       "'4  STATE  DECCANHERALD Wednesday June 10, 2020     Aadhaar enrolment now under  Jana Sevaka  BENGALURU, DHNS: The state government will now bring enrolment for Aadhaar, APL card and voters ID under the flagship Jana Sevaka service delivery programme.  According to Sakala Min- ister S Suresh Kumar, the Jana Sevaka programme coveres 50 services, includ- ing issue caste and income certificates, pension, labour and health, among others. Under the programme, ser- vices are delivered at the doorsteps of citizens at a nominal fee.  \"Aaadhaar has become mandatory for almost all transactions of late. Hence, the department decided to include it under Jana Sevaka to help senior citizens and those who cannot afford to go out themselves to get the en- rolment done,\" Kumar said, after holding a meeting with officials.  The Jana Sevaka pro- gramme, which was tem- porarily stopped owing to the lockdown, would be restarted again, Kumar said, adding that the Jana Sevaka personnel would take all Covid-related precautionary measures while interacting with citizens.

Ifallthesix units are function- al, the Almatti plant can gener- ate 6 MUs daily.  Only one unit with 15 MW ca- pacity was functional for three days in the last one week. Even that too has stopped producing power from Saturday. For now, all six units have stopped gener- ating power.  The units will run to their op- timum level in July, if the reser- voir continues to receive steady inflows, the Superintending Engineer added.              India, China begin moves to end stand-off  China, from Page 1  India had moved a battalion from its brigade located at Dualat Beg Oldie after the PLA increased its troop strength.  The Chinese needling at the Galwan valley appar- ently was to slow down the construction of a feeder link to the Darbuk-Shy- ok-DBO road that was made operational last year, providing the much needed connectivity to the world\\'s highest airstrip at DBO, close to the Karakoram pass.  But neither side crossed the LAC at Galwan valley, which was never really a contested area.  The resolution of the stand-off at Finger-4 area, however, would take more time as the area between Finger 4 and Finger 8 re- mains a hotly contested one.  For years, the finger are- as and the 135-km-long pris- tine Ladakh lake remained a flash point between Indian and Chinese troops.  According to the Indian perception of the Line of Actual Control, the disput- ed border runs through Fin- ger 8 (the spurs or mountain ridges are named as fingers) because of which Indian troops could go up to that point for patrolling. Going by the Chinese perception, the LAC runs through Fin- ger 4.

Asked why the govern- ment was silent on com- munity transmission, John argued that the officials probably have a mindset that they knew \"all sources of infection\", which was an \"obviously untenable claim\".  \"This may have made them deny community transmission defined as \\'un- known person(s) transmit- ting infection\\'. Such claim also shows lack of deep un- derstanding of the dynamics of introduced epidemics.\"  Medical scientists also ob- served that one of the rea- sons for the government\\'s denial could be a line of thinking that the acceptance of community transmissions is tantamount to acceptance  of the government\\'s failure to stem the outbreak.  \"The government should not feel embarrassed about it. It is fully expected. This is how an epidemic grows. It cannot be considered as a failure on the part of the government because of the nature of the disease. They (officials) are worried that this may be called as their failure, but nobody in the world can do anything about it,\" said Jayaprakash Muliyil, former principal, CMC Vel- lore, and chairperson of the scientific advisory commit- tee of the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai- one of the ICMR institutes.  Two ICMR studies pub- lished in the last two months gave a clear indication of the Covid-19 outbreak moving from the local transmission stage to community trans- mission.
